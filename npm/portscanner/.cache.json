The What\n\nThe portscanner module is an asynchronous JavaScript port scanner for Node.js.\n\nPortscanner can check a port, or range of ports, for 'open' or 'closed'\nstatuses.\n\n## The How\n\n### To Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install portscanner\n```\n\n### To Use\n\nA brief example:\n\n```javascript\nvar portscanner = require('portscanner')\n\n// Checks the status of a single port\nportscanner.checkPortStatus(3000, '127.0.0.1', function(error, status) {\n  // Status is 'open' if currently in use or 'closed' if available\n  console.log(status)\n})\n\n// Find the first available port. Asynchronously checks, so first port\n// determined as available is returned.\nportscanner.findAPortNotInUse(3000, 3010, '127.0.0.1', function(error, port) {\n  console.log('AVAILABLE PORT AT: ' + port)\n})\n\n// Find the first port in use or blocked. Asynchronously checks, so first port\n// to respond is returned.\nportscanner.findAPortInUse(3000, 3010, '127.0.0.1', function(error, port) {\n  console.log('PORT IN USE AT: ' + port)\n})\n```\n\nThe example directory contains a more detailed example.\n\n### To Test\n\nBleh. I am a fan of testing, but currently looking into an easier way to test\nseveral HTTP connections. If any ideas, please message me.\n\n## The Future\n\nPlease create issues, or better yet, pull requests, for port scanning related\nfeatures you'd like to see included.\n\n## The License (MIT)\n\nReleased under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for the complete wording.\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/baalexander/node-portscanner","keywords":["portscanner","port","scanner","checker","status"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/baalexander/node-portscanner/issues"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"N65ASDBZPG7Q7I6J1OC8QYEO\""}
