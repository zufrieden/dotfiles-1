wiredep\n> Wire dependencies to your source code.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nInstall the module with: `npm install --save wiredep`\n\n\n## Build Chain Integration\n\n### [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/)\n\nwiredep works with [streams](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook) and integrates with gulp.js out of the box:\n\n```js\nvar wiredep = require('wiredep').stream;\n\ngulp.task('bower', function () {\n  gulp.src('./src/footer.html')\n    .pipe(wiredep({\n      optional: 'configuration',\n      goes: 'here'\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dest'));\n});\n```\n\n### [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)\n\nSee [`grunt-bower-install`](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-bower-install).\n\n\n## Programmatic Access\nYou can

object in your own `bower.json`.\n\nAs an example, this is what your `bower.json` may look like if you wanted to override `package-without-main`'s `main` file:\n\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"package-without-main\": \"1.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"package-without-main\": {\n      \"main\": \"dist/package-without-main.js\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using `npm test`.\n\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2014 Stephen Sawchuk.
