[minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).\n\n## Why another file globbing library?\n\nI wanted to make [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) work on Windows. Unfortunately, [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) doesn't work on Windows, and [miniglob](https://github.com/isaacs/miniglob) isn't synchronous. And this needed to be synchronous.\n\n## Any issues?\n\nThis library works with any path that [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) supports, and is the core of the [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) wildcard globbing methods.\n\nTo be fair, this library isn't terribly efficient. But that's ok, because it's mainly used with relatively small folder structures. Maybe someone will help improve this library (patches welcome!). Or maybe even write a better library, and then I'll use that instead.

Added `options.maxDepth` unit tests.\n* 2012/04/10 - v0.1.5 - Fixed an issue where using the `matchBase` minimatch option with simple patterns would fail.\n* 2012/03/26 - v0.1.4 - Fixed a minor issue with absolute paths on Windows.\n* 2012/03/25 - v0.1.3 - Updated to minimatch 0.2.2+.
