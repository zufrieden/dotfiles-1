# YeoPress

A [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman) generator for WordPress.  Installs WordPress from scratch, pulls in a custom theme and configures your `wp_config.php`.

## How To Use

Install the generator:

	npm install yeoman-yeopress

Then in the directory you want to install WordPress:

	yeoman init wordpress

Viola!

## Yo

Of course a new version of yeoman just came out and I had progress on this with the old version.  I will hopefully update this within the week...
