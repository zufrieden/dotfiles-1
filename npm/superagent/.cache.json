For example we can check `res.status`, `res.header` for header fields, `res.text`, `res.body` etc.\n\nAn example of a JSON POST with jQuery typically might use `$.post()`, however once you need to start defining header fields you have to then re-write it using `$.ajax()`... so that might look like:\n\n```js\n$.ajax({\n  url: '/api/pet',\n  type: 'POST',\n  data: { name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' },\n  headers: { 'X-API-Key': 'foobar' }\n}).success(function(res){\n\n}).error(function(){\n\n});\n```\n\n Not only is it ugly it's pretty opinionated, jQuery likes to special-case {4,5}xx, for example you cannot (easily at least) receive a parsed JSON response for say \"400 Bad Request\".
